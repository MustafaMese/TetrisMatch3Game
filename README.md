# TetrisMatch3Game

## Overview

This Unity project serves as my learning starting point for implementing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture in Unity. I've deliberately avoided using Coroutines and opted to utilize async-await keywords for asynchronous operations.

### Prerequisites

- Unity (version 2022.3.11f1)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Unity.
